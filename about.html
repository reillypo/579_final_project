                        <p>	
                            I began my freshman year at the University of Michigan in September 2016. Going in I had little idea
                            what to expect, but I started to explore the opportunities that UM provides.

                            After trying out several different academic paths like engineering I decided to pursue economics.

                        <p>	
                            I was enjoying economics, but found that the work was almost entirely theoretical and individual.
                            So, I was looking for a minor that would give me soft skills such as presenting and also allow me to
                            work in groups. After extensive research, I decided to pursue the entrepreneurship minor, and I'm glad
                            I did!

                            My first intership was with Hagerty, an insurance company based in Traverse City, Michigan. I moved to TC for the
                            the summer and worked with the Hagerty Specialty Team. Our team specialized in high-performance motorsports, so the

                            I completed my bachelors degree at the University of Michigan during the spring of 2020. I had finished my degree from home

                            After graduation, I had two options, get a job, or continue on in my education. I decided to continue my education, but that meant I needed
                            an internship for the summer. I had been applying for full-time job offers, so I did not have anything lined up. So, I ended up working for my father
                            and redesigned his website. I also participated in the sales side of the business.
